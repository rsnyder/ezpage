The ==Vainakh tower architecture=={Q6960545}, also called Nakh architecture, is a characteristic feature of ancient and medieval architecture of ==Chechnya=={Q5187} and ==Ingushetia=={Q5219}.

## History

The oldest fortifications in the North Caucasus date from the 3rd millennium BC[^1]. The oldest remains of buildings with the characteristics of Nakh towers date from the 1st century AD, and can already be distinguished into residential and military types. Construction greatly increased in the 12th and 13th centuries. Nakh tower architecture and construction techniques[^2] reached their peak in the 15th–17th centuries. Vainakh architecture was introduced to north-eastern Georgia (Dartlo, Tusheti) by Vainakh builders.

## General features

Typical Vainakh towers were built on a ==square base=={3295,2741,751,500}, ranging from 6 to 12 m wide and 10 to 25 m high, depending on the function. The walls were built of stone blocks, possibly with lime, clay-lime, or lime-sand mortar. The walls were inclined inwards and their thickness decreased on higher floors. The towers were built on hard rock.

Vainakh towers used to be sparingly decorated with religious or good-wishing petrographs, such as solar signs, depictions of the author’s hands, or animals.

The construction of a tower, whether residential or military, was accompanied by rituals. Songs and folk tales emphasize the role of the "master builder", who, according to tradition, would direct a group of assistants who did the actual work. Some of these masters had their names preserved—such as Diskhi, associated in the local tradition to the military tower of Vougi, and Yand of the Ingush settlement Erzi. Chechen villages, such as Bavloi also specialized in tower building. Legends ascribe to the master builder the honourable and extremely dangerous task of erecting the tsIurku stone that topped the step pyramidal roof of a military tower. A ladder was tied to a machicolation on the outside for the master to reach the roof. It cost many masters their life. In case of success, the client gave the master a bull. The construction of a family tower cost the household 50 to 60 cows.

Ivan Shcheblykin claimed that the tower builders did not need any scaffolding,[1] and many researchers make that assumption. However, he may have meant that they used no scaffolding on the outside.

Cornerstones were included in the design, to join the walls together and to support the higher floors. Interior scaffolds used in erecting the walls probably rested on those cornerstones, in which corbels were made for the purpose. Stones and beams were lifted with a windlass known as chIagIarg or zerazak. Large stones—some weighing several tons—were brought to the site by oxdriven sleds. The builders used many stonedressing tools—the berg (pick), the varzap (a large hammer), the jau (a small hammer), the daam (chisel), etc. Mortar was made on the site. Sand or clay was admixed to it in localities where lime was expensive. One of the master builder's most critical tasks was to estimate the proper amount of mortar to ensure the seismic resistance of the tower. Joints between stones were filled in with limewash for rain not to damage mortar.
